# ClassModelForecast
This package is a set of functions which 	output time series forecasts of a financial institution's 	PPPNR, Capital, NCO, and other variables. The heart of the 	implementation is an Arima regression on inputs of macroeconomic 	scenarios (base, adverse, or severely adverse) and bank position data.
