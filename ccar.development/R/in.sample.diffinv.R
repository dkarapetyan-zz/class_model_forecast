#' Generate the in sample inverse of a diff based on another time series.
#' 
#' This function restores a series from which is taken the difference with diff.
#'
#' @param series The series that should be used as input.
#' @param xi.series The series that should be used as in sample forecast.
#' @return the resulting series. If xi.series is a time series the returned
#' object will have the same properties as that time series.

#'  a <- 2 : 20
