\section{Description Per Task}
\subsection{\taskUnivariate}
\subsubsection{Outline}
Univariate tests have to be performed on a time series to assess whether it can
be used in PPNR modeling. It depends on the purpose of the time series which
tests should be passed. 

\subsubsection{Completed}
Currently a test exists that performs three statistical tests on a time series
as well as a PACF and ACF plot. The three tests can be printed directly into 
R or as a table using knitr.

\subsubsection{ToDo}
Additional tests must be added such as heteroskedasticity and possibly more
advanced stationarity tests. (for questions contact Anton Bossenbroek)


\subsection{\taskMultiVariate}
\subsubsection{Outline}
Multivariate tests must be performed on time series to assess whether they can
be used in conjunction as explanatory variables in a model.

\subsubsection{Completed}

\subsubsection{ToDo}
Implement correlation, PCA and collinearity tests. (for questions contact Anton Bossenbroek)



\subsection{\taskARIMA}
\subsubsection{Outline}
SAS includes a model where the error of the time series can follow a certain
time series. R has a similar model. See for more information
\url{https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat510/node/72}. The package
\verb!nlme! e.g.,\\
\indent\verb!gls(Y ~ X, correlation=corARMA(p=1,q=1))!.\\
\noindent It would be nice if we could be more selective which lags we wish to
include. (for questions contact Anton Bossenbroek)
